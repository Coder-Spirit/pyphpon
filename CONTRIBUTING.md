PyPhpOn Contributing Guidelines
====================================

Contributing with Code
----------------------

In first place, if you want to contribute code to pyphpon, you should have installed some PHP version,
preferably recent versions (PHP>=5.4, but recommended PHP>=5.6), or *HHVM*.

If you don't know where to start, you can try searching inside the
[issues list](https://github.com/Litipk/pyphpon/issues). Specially the ones marked with the
[help wanted](https://github.com/Litipk/pyphpon/labels/help%20wanted) tag.

Some extra advices related on good practices:
 * We try to follow the PSR standards, in special **PSR-1**, **PSR-2** and **PSR-4**.
 * Every new added feature should come with unit tests, stability and code correctness is an
   important priority of this project.


Contributing with Documentation
-------------------------------

If you want to contribute documentation, you're welcome! :) , BUT, actually the documentation is pretty bad,
and it's perfectly undersandable that this task isn't very attractive.

Contributing with Bug Reports
-----------------------------

A very important part of every software project is the bugs tracking and solving process. You can send us bug reports
through the [tracker](https://github.com/Litipk/pyphpon/issues).

It's desirable that every bug report explains the bug in a way that the developers can easily reproduce it. The
following points are very helpful in order to achieve reproducibility:
* Example code.
* pyphpon version.
* PHP version

Contributing with New Ideas
---------------------------

You can use the github [tracker](https://github.com/Litipk/pyphpon/issues) to send us new ideas, even if those ideas
aren't bug reports. In such case, adding something like "SUGGESTION: ...", "IMPROVEMENT: ..." to the report bug it's a
good idea.
